## Synopsis

The Production Mode extension adds a `production-mode` parameter of `production` or `development` to the Parameter Pool. This allows XSLT templates to perform logic based on production mode. It is primarily designed to work with [Symphony No.5](http://github.com/firegoby/symphonyno5.git) to help select between compiled/minified and development assets (e.g. `<script>`, `<link>`) depending on production mode.
